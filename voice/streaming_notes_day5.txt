Batch audio:
- Record full audio first, then send to STT
- Higher latency because processing starts after recording ends

Streaming audio:
- Send audio in small chunks continuously
- STT returns partial transcripts in real time
- Can start generating response earlier (lower perceived latency)

Latency sources:
- STT network call
- Agent processing
- TTS generation + audio playback
